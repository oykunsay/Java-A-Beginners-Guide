# Chapter 3 Self Test

Q1: Write a program that reads characters from the keyboard until a period is received. Have the program count the number of spaces. Report the total at the end of the program. > See SentenceSpaceFinder.java

Q2: Show the general form of the if-else-if ladder. > if(condition) stmt; else if(condition2) stmt; else if...

Q3: What if does the last else associate? > I was going to say x<10 but it associates with y>100

Q4: Show the for statement for a loop that counts from 1000 to 0 by â€“2. > for(x = 1000; x > -2; x -= -2)

Q5: Is the following fragment valid? > No bc i isn't in the scope.

Q6: Explain what break does. Be sure to explain both of its forms. > Breaks are the most immediate enclosing block,loop or the specified label.

Q7: In the following fragment, after the break statement executes, what is displayed? > "after while"

Q8: 01 \n 23 \n 45 \n 67 \n 89

Q9: The iteration expression in a for loop need not always alter the loop control variable by a fixed amount. Instead, the loop control variable can change in any arbitrary way. Using this concept, write a program that uses a for loop to generate and display the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. > See QuesOfTwo.java

Q10:  The ASCII lowercase letters are separated from the uppercase letters by 32. Thus, to convert a lowercase letter to uppercase, subtract 32 from it. Use this information to write a program that reads characters from the keyboard. Have it convert all lowercase letters to uppercase, and all uppercase letters to lowercase, displaying the result. Make no changes to any other character. Have the program stop when the user enters a period. At the end, have the program display the number of case changes that have taken place. > See CaseChange.java

Q11: What is an infinite loop? > A loop that never terminates.

Q12: When using break with a label, must the label be on a block that contains the break? Yes.
